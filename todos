Goal: We have multiple KPIs (interceptions, duels, positioning scores, ...) on the player-position-match and total player-position level in a season. We want to analyse the stability, discrimination, independence and validity of the new metrics and compare with old ones.

Methods:
1. ICC (stability, discrimination)
-- (DONE) Uncorrected for position: MM for players/player-matches vs KPIs, do this for each position.
-- DONE Corrected for position: MM for players/player-matched corrected by position vs KPIs, do this once.
-- DONE Player-position-match-level to check whether Player performances are stable and discriminative on the match level
-- Player-position level: Bootstrap matches (within player-variance) and compare with between-player variance (quasi-ICC)
2. Collinearity analysis
-- DONE KPI1 vs KPI2 (Player-position-level, Player-position-match level)
3. Hin vs Rück correlation
-- DONE Correlation within KPIs across player-positions
4. Descriptive analysis
-- DONE Histogram per KPI (colored by position)
5. Validity correlation analysis
-- DONE Overall correlation KPI corrected for Position vs REF (linear model? variant?), do once.
-- DONE regular correlation KPI vs REF, do per Position
6. Maybe time to convergence
-- Per player-position: X=Minutes vs Y=delta KPI from final value.

# Run reduction again - there was a bug - then run involvement and matchsums again and check if results are ok now. Maybe do Resp etc. per Pass!

TODOS
- reprocess all involvements and following data + add men's data
- check and harmonize  of cont/fault minus/plus (make fault negative, contribution positive, valued involvement sum? raw involvement absolute sum?)
- New KPI: Difference Involvement vs Responsibility, Absolute Involvement/Responsibility, Interceptions/Tackles per Pass
- run a bit of analysis: e.g. x-y-plot fault vs contribution, inv vs resp etc.

Conclusions
- Which ICC higher than interceptions_per90? Shows higher match-to-match stability.
